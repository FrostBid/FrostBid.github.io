  <h2> Cuban Missile Crisis </h2>
  <p id=tribute-text>
    On 27 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a group of United States Navy ships located the Foxtrot-class submarine B-59 near Cuba. Despite being in international waters, the United States Navy started dropping signaling depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. <br><br>
    
    Hiding from the US Navy bombardment, B-59 was too deep to monitor any radio traffic, and those on board did not know whether war had broken out or not. The captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo. The three officers on board B-59 had to agree unanimously to authorize a nuclear launch: An argument broke out among the officers, with only Arkhipov against the launch. A nuclear fallout was narrowly avoided.<br><br>
      
Many years later in 2002, retired Commander Vadim Pavlovich Orlov, a participant in the events, held a press conference revealing the submarines were armed with nuclear torpedoes and that Arkhipov was the reason those devices had not been fired. Orlov presented the events less dramatically, saying that Captain Savitsky lost his temper, but eventually calmed down. The nuclear crisis was averted.<br><br>

When discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis in 2002, Robert McNamara, the U.S. Secretary of Defense at the time, stated, "We came very close" to nuclear war, "closer than we knew at the time."
